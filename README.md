No.

## What does Skeið mean?

A **skeið** is a type of Scandinavian viking-age warship.
They were the largest type of longship, having 30 or more rowing benches.

The name **skeið** means "slider" in Old Norse, possibly referring to the high speed of these ships.
This word is cognate with the modern English word "sheath",
via Old English word **scēaþ** meaning the same,
and having the Proto-Indo-European root **\*skei-** meaning "to cut or split".

The name can be anglicized to "skeid", however the original Old Norse word would have been
pronounced like the English word "scathe",
which is also how the name of this library should be pronounced.
