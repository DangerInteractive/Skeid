# Skeið

**a linear algebra library for game graphics and physics**

## Is this ready to use in my project?

No.

## How is Skeið pronounced?

While the name can be anglicized to **skeid**,
the original Old Norse word would have been pronounced like the English word **scathe**,
which is also how the name of this library should be pronounced.

## What does Skeið mean?

A **skeið** is a type of Scandinavian viking-age warship.
They were the largest type of longship, having 30 or more rowing benches.

The name **skeið** means "slider" in Old Norse, possibly referring to the high speed of these ships.
This word is cognate with the modern English word **sheath**,
via Old English word **scēaþ** meaning the same as the modern english,
and having the Proto-Indo-European root **\*skei-** meaning "to cut or split".

It is named as such because I thought it's a cool word,
because other components of the TimberWolf game engine have Norse-inspired names,
and because I want this math to move easily and quickly just like the eponymous ship.
